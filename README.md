# x86_syscall_ref
An x86 linux syscall table reference tool. Handy for when writing shellcode and exploits.

It allows you to search via function name or syscall id and returns the relevant information for setting up the stack / registers in x86 assembly. All of the syscall data is stored inside the script so no need for internet access.
